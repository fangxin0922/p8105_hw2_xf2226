# Problem 1

## Read in and clean Mr. Trash Wheel sheet

``` r
mr_trash_wheel_df <- readxl::read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx", sheet = 1, range = cellranger::cell_cols("A:N"), skip = 1) %>% # specified the sheet in the Excel file, using sheet = 1; omited non-data entries, using range = cellranger::cell_cols("A:N") and skip = 1
  janitor::clean_names() %>% #use reasonable variable names
  filter(!is.na(dumpster)) %>% #omit rows that do not include dumpster-specific data
  head(-1) #dropped last row which includes the total

mr_trash_wheel_df$sports_balls <- round(pull(mr_trash_wheel_df, sports_balls), 0) #round the number of sports balls to the nearest integer
```

## Read and clean precipitation data for 2018 and 2019

``` r
sheets <- readxl::excel_sheets("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx") #read in sheets

precipitation_2018_2019 <- do.call(rbind, lapply(sheets[6:7], function(X) 
        transform(readxl::read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx", sheet = X, skip = 1), sheetname = X))) #rbind the two seperate sheets and add a column containing the sheetnames

precipitation_2018_2019 <- precipitation_2018_2019 %>% 
  na.omit(Total) %>% #omit rows without precipitation data
  mutate(Year = substr(sheetname, 1, 4), Month = month.name[Month]) %>%  #add a variable for year and convert month to a character variable
  select(Year, Month, Total) %>% 
  as_tibble()
```

There are 453 observations in the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset and 24
observations in the precipitation dataset for year 2018 and 2019.

Some of the key variables in the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset are:  
`year` and `month` represents the year and month of trash collection  
`dumpster` column includes specific dumpster number  
`sports_balls` column includes the number of sports balls collected in
Mr. Trash Wheel on the given specific date and dumpster. The mean number
of sports balls is 11.7461369. And the median number of sports balls in
the dumpster in 2019 specifically is 9  
`weight_tons` represents the weight of trash in tons collected by
Mr. Trash Wheel on a given dumpster and date  

Some of the key variables in the precipitation dataset for year 2018 and
2019 are:  
`Year` represents the year of precipitation measuremens  
`Month` is the month of precipitation measurement  
`Total` column includes the total precipitation for the year-month  

The total precipitation measured in 2018 is 70.33

# Problem 2

## read and clean pols\_month

``` r
rm(list = ls()) #clean environment to start a new problem

pols_month <- read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>% #load pols_month dataset
  janitor::clean_names() 

pols_month <- pols_month %>%
  separate(mon, sep = "-", into = c("year", "month","day")) %>% #Use separate() to break up the variable mon into integer variables year, month, and day
  mutate(
    year = as.integer(year), 
    month = as.integer(month), 
    day = as.integer(day),
    month = month.name[month]) %>% 
  pivot_longer(c("prez_gop","prez_dem"), #a president variable taking values gop and dem
    names_to = "president",
    values_to = "president_boolean",
    names_prefix = "prez_"
  ) %>% 
  filter(president_boolean != 0) %>% 
  select(-c(president_boolean, day)) #remove the day variable
```

## read and clean the data in snp.csv

``` r
snp <- read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") %>% #load snp dataset
  janitor::clean_names() 

snp <- snp %>%
  separate(date, sep = "/", into = c("month", "day", "year")) %>% 
  mutate(
    year = as.integer(ifelse(year > 21, paste0("19",year), paste0("20",year))), 
    month = month.name[as.integer(month)]) %>% 
  select(year, month, close) %>% #year and month are the leading columns
  arrange(year, month) #arrange according to year and month
```

## read and tidy unemplotment data

``` r
unemployment <- read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() 

unemployment <- unemployment %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    jan:dec, 
    names_to = 'month', 
    values_to = "unemployment_rate"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    year = as.integer(year),
    month = apply(as.matrix(month), 1, function(abb){
      s <- str_to_title(abb)
      for (i in 1:12) {
        if (month.abb[i] == s ) {
          return(month.name[i])
        }
      }
    }
    ))
```

## Join the datasets by merging snp into pols, and merging unemployment into the result.

``` r
fivethirtyeight_merged <- pols_month %>% 
  left_join(snp, by = c("year", "month")) %>% 
  left_join(unemployment, by = c("year", "month"))
```

Write a short paragraph about these datasets. Explain briefly what each
dataset contained, and describe the resulting dataset (e.g. give the
dimension, range of years, and names of key variables).

 The pols-month dataset contains 822 observations of 9 variables related
to the number of national politicians who are democratic or republican
at the given year-month. The newly created variable `president` in this
dataset indicates whether the president in office in the associated
year-month was republican (`gop`) or democratic (`dem`)

 The snp dataset contains 787 observations of 3 variables related to
Standard & Poor’s stock market index on the given year-month.

 The unemployment dataset contains 816 observations of 3 variables
including the percentage of unemployment in a given month and year.

 All these 3 datasets were merged to a final dataframe called
`fivethirtyeight_merged`. This final data frame contains 822
observations of 11 variables. The data years range from year 1947 to
year 2015. Overall, this final data frame includes the number of
senator, representative, governor of each party, party of the president
in office, the closing values of the S&P stock index, and the
unemployment rate on the associated year and month. Key variables:

-   `close` = the closing values of the S&P stock index on the
    associated month and year
-   `unemplyment_rate` = percentage of unemployment of the associated
    month and year
-   `president` = whether the president in office in the associated
    year-month was republican (`gop`) or democratic (`dem`)
-   `gov_gop`: the number of republican governors on the associated
    month and year
-   `sen_gop`: the number of republican senators on the associated month
    and year
-   `rep_gop`: the number of republican representatives on the
    associated month and year
-   `gov_dem`: the number of democratic governors on the associated
    month and year
-   `sen_dem`: the number of democratic senators on the associated month
    and year
-   `rep_dem`: the number of democratic representatives on the
    associated month and year
